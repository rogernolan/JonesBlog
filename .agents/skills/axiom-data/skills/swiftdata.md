# SwiftData

## Overview

Apple's native persistence framework using `@Model` classes and declarative queries. Built on Core Data, designed for SwiftUI.

**Core principle** Reference types (`class`) + `@Model` macro + declarative `@Query` for reactive SwiftUI integration.

**Requires** iOS 17+, Swift 5.9+
**Target** iOS 26+ (this skill focuses on latest features)
**License** Proprietary (Apple)

## When to Use SwiftData

#### Choose SwiftData when you need
- ✅ Native Apple integration with SwiftUI
- ✅ Simple CRUD operations
- ✅ Automatic UI updates with `@Query`
- ✅ CloudKit sync (iOS 17+)
- ✅ Reference types (classes) with relationships

#### Use SQLiteData instead when
- Need value types (structs)
- CloudKit record sharing (not just sync)
- Large datasets (50k+ records) with specific performance needs

#### Use GRDB when
- Complex raw SQL required
- Fine-grained migration control needed

**For migrations** See the `skills/swiftdata-migration.md` skill for custom schema migrations with VersionedSchema and SchemaMigrationPlan. For migration debugging, see `skills/swiftdata-migration-diag.md`.

## Example Prompts

These are real questions developers ask that this skill is designed to answer:

#### Basic Operations

#### 1. "I have a notes app with folders. I need to filter notes by folder and sort by last modified. How do I set up the @Query?"
→ The skill shows how to use `@Query` with predicates, sorting, and automatic view updates

#### 2. "When a user deletes a task list, all tasks should auto-delete too. How do I set up the relationship?"
→ The skill explains `@Relationship` with `deleteRule: .cascade` and inverse relationships

#### 3. "I have a relationship between User → Messages → Attachments. How do I prevent orphaned data when deleting?"
→ The skill shows cascading deletes, inverse relationships, and safe deletion patterns

#### CloudKit & Sync

#### 4. "My chat app syncs messages to other devices via CloudKit. Sometimes messages conflict. How do I handle sync conflicts?"
→ The skill covers CloudKit integration, conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, custom resolution), and sync patterns

#### 5. "I'm adding CloudKit sync to my app, but I get 'Property must have a default value' error. What's wrong?"
→ The skill explains CloudKit constraints: all properties must be optional or have defaults, explains why (network timing), and shows fixes

#### 6. "I want to show users when their data is syncing to iCloud and what happens when they're offline."
→ The skill shows monitoring sync status with notifications, detecting network connectivity, and offline-aware UI patterns

#### 7. "I need to share a playlist with other users. How do I implement CloudKit record sharing?"
→ The skill covers CloudKit record sharing patterns (iOS 26+) with owner/permission tracking and sharing metadata

#### Performance & Optimization

#### 8. "I need to query 50,000 messages but only display 20 at a time. How do I paginate efficiently?"
→ The skill covers performance patterns, batch fetching, limiting queries, and preventing memory bloat with chunked imports

#### 9. "My app loads 100 tasks with relationships, and displaying them is slow. I think it's N+1 queries."
→ The skill shows how to identify N+1 problems without prefetching, provides prefetching pattern, and shows 100x performance improvement

#### 10. "I'm importing 1 million records from an API. What's the best way to batch them without running out of memory?"
→ The skill shows chunk-based importing with periodic saves, memory cleanup patterns, and batch operation optimization

#### 11. "Which properties should I add indexes to? I'm worried about over-indexing slowing down writes."
→ The skill explains index optimization patterns: when to index (frequently filtered/sorted properties), when to avoid (rarely used, frequently changing), maintenance costs

#### Migration from Legacy Frameworks

#### 12. "We're migrating from Realm/Core Data to SwiftData"
→ See the comparison table in Migration section below, then follow `skills/realm-migration-ref.md` or `skills/swiftdata-migration.md` for detailed guides

## @Model Definitions

### Basic Model

```swift
import SwiftData

@Model
final class Track {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: String
    var title: String
    var artist: String
    var duration: TimeInterval
    var genre: String?

    init(id: String, title: String, artist: String, duration: TimeInterval, genre: String? = nil) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.artist = artist
        self.duration = duration
        self.genre = genre
    }
}
```

#### Key patterns
- Use `final class`, not `struct` (omit `final` if you need subclasses — see Class Inheritance below)
- Use `@Attribute(.unique)` for primary key-like behavior (not supported with CloudKit sync — see CloudKit Constraints below)
- Provide explicit `init` (SwiftData doesn't synthesize)
- Optional properties (`String?`) are nullable
- Use `@Attribute(.preserveValueOnDeletion)` on properties whose values should survive even after the object is deleted (useful for analytics, audit trails)

### Relationships

```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: String
    var title: String

    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Album.tracks)
    var album: Album?

    init(id: String, title: String, album: Album? = nil) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
        self.album = album
    }
}

@Model
final class Album {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: String
    var title: String

    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)
    var tracks: [Track] = []

    init(id: String, title: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
    }
}
```

### Many-to-Many Self-Referential Relationships

```swift
@MainActor  // Required for Swift 6 strict concurrency
@Model
final class User {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: String
    var name: String

    // Users following this user (inverse relationship)
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .nullify, inverse: \User.following)
    var followers: [User] = []

    // Users this user is following
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .nullify)
    var following: [User] = []

    init(id: String, name: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

#### CRITICAL: SwiftData automatically manages BOTH sides when you modify ONE side.

✅ **Correct — Only modify ONE side**
```swift
// user1 follows user2 (modifying ONE side)
user1.following.append(user2)
try modelContext.save()

// SwiftData AUTOMATICALLY updates user2.followers
// Don't manually append to both sides - causes duplicates!
```

❌ **Wrong — Don't manually update both sides**
```swift
user1.following.append(user2)
user2.followers.append(user1)  // Redundant! Creates duplicates in CloudKit sync
```

#### Unfollowing (remove from ONE side only)
```swift
user1.following.removeAll { $0.id == user2.id }
try modelContext.save()
// user2.followers automatically updated
```

#### Verifying relationship integrity (for debugging)
```swift
// Check if relationship is truly bidirectional
let user1FollowsUser2 = user1.following.contains { $0.id == user2.id }
let user2FollowedByUser1 = user2.followers.contains { $0.id == user1.id }

// These MUST always match after save()
assert(user1FollowsUser2 == user2FollowedByUser1, "Relationship corrupted!")
```

#### CloudKit Sync Recovery (if relationships become corrupted)
```swift
// If CloudKit sync creates duplicate/orphaned relationships:

// 1. Backup current state
let backup = user.following.map { $0.id }

// 2. Clear relationships
user.following.removeAll()
user.followers.removeAll()
try modelContext.save()

// 3. Rebuild from source of truth (e.g., API)
for followingId in backup {
    if let followingUser = fetchUser(id: followingId) {
        user.following.append(followingUser)
    }
}
try modelContext.save()

// 4. Force CloudKit resync (in ModelConfiguration)
// Re-create ModelContainer to force full sync after corruption recovery
```

#### Delete rules
- `.cascade` - Delete related objects
- `.nullify` - Set relationship to nil
- `.deny` - Prevent deletion if relationship exists
- `.noAction` - Leave relationship as-is (careful!)

## Codable Attributes for Unowned Types (OS27)

SwiftData builds its schema by inspecting a model's stored properties. A stored property whose type is a **class you don't own** (e.g. `MKMapItem.Identifier`) can't be inspected and crashes at launch:

```
Fatal error: Class property within Persisted Struct/Enum is not supported
```

If that type is `Codable`, mark the attribute `@Attribute(.codable)` (`OS27`) — SwiftData persists its encoded form instead of inferring a schema:

```swift
@Model
final class Trip {
    var name: String
    @Attribute(.codable) var mapItemIdentifier: MKMapItem.Identifier?   // OS27
}
```

**It's an escape hatch, not a default.** The stored blob is opaque to SwiftData, so a `.codable` attribute:
- **can't** appear in a `#Predicate` (filtering), a `SortDescriptor` (sorting), or an index;
- **won't** trigger a migration when its shape changes — you own keeping the type's `Codable` conformance forward/backward compatible.

For types you *do* own, model them as `@Model` or supported value types so you keep filtering, sorting, and indexing. (`.codable` is the modern cousin of transformable attributes.)

## Class Inheritance

SwiftData supports class inheritance for hierarchical models. Use when you have a clear IS-A relationship (e.g., `BusinessTrip` IS-A `Trip`) and need both broad queries (all trips) and type-specific queries.

### Base and Subclass Pattern

Apply `@Model` to both base class and subclasses. Omit `final` on the base class.

```swift
@Model class Trip {
    @Attribute(.preserveValueOnDeletion)
    var name: String
    var destination: String
    var startDate: Date
    var endDate: Date

    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Accommodation.trip)
    var accommodation: Accommodation?

    init(name: String, destination: String, startDate: Date, endDate: Date) {
        self.name = name
        self.destination = destination
        self.startDate = startDate
        self.endDate = endDate
    }
}

@Model class BusinessTrip: Trip {
    var purpose: String
    var expenseCode: String

    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \BusinessMeal.trip)
    var businessMeals: [BusinessMeal] = []

    init(name: String, destination: String, startDate: Date, endDate: Date,
         purpose: String, expenseCode: String) {
        self.purpose = purpose
        self.expenseCode = expenseCode
        super.init(name: name, destination: destination, startDate: startDate, endDate: endDate)
    }
}
```

### Type-Based Queries with #Predicate

Query all base class instances (includes subclasses), or filter by type:

```swift
// All trips (includes BusinessTrip, PersonalTrip, etc.)
@Query(sort: \Trip.startDate) var allTrips: [Trip]

// Only business trips — use `is` in #Predicate
@Query(filter: #Predicate<Trip> { $0 is BusinessTrip }) var businessTrips: [Trip]

// Filter on subclass-specific properties — use `as?` cast
let vacationPredicate = #Predicate<Trip> {
    if let personal = $0 as? PersonalTrip {
        return personal.reason == .vacation
    }
    return false
}
@Query(filter: vacationPredicate) var vacationTrips: [Trip]
```

### Composing Compound Predicates Dynamically (`OS27`)

`#Predicate` is resolved at compile time, so you can't build one from a runtime array (e.g. a user's checked filter options). Foundation's `Predicate(all:)` / `Predicate(any:)` (`OS27`, all platforms) fold a collection of subpredicates into one with AND / OR:

```swift
@available(anyAppleOS 27, *)
func tripFilter(for tags: [String]) -> Predicate<Trip> {
    let clauses = tags.map { tag in #Predicate<Trip> { $0.tags.contains(tag) } }
    return Predicate(any: clauses)        // OR; use `all:` for AND
}
// ...
@Query(filter: tripFilter(for: selectedTags)) var matching: [Trip]
```

Guard the empty-collection case: by the usual AND/OR identity an empty `all:` matches everything and an empty `any:` matches nothing, so "no filters selected" should be handled explicitly rather than fed in as `[]`. Before `OS27` the only option was nesting boolean operators inside a single compile-time `#Predicate`, which can't be assembled from a runtime array.

Relationships typed to the base class can hold mixed subclass instances:

```swift
@Model class TravelPlanner {
    var name: String

    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade)
    var upcomingTrips: [Trip] = []  // Can contain BusinessTrip and PersonalTrip

    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
}
```

Cast to access subclass-specific properties:

```swift
for trip in planner.upcomingTrips {
    if let business = trip as? BusinessTrip {
        print(business.expenseCode)
    }
}
```

### When to Use Inheritance vs Alternatives

| Signal | Use Inheritance | Use Enum/Flag Instead |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Subclasses share many base properties | Yes | — |
| Need type-based queries across all models | Yes | — |
| Subclasses have their own relationships | Yes | — |
| Only 1-2 distinguishing properties | — | Yes |
| Query only on specialized properties | — | Yes |
| Protocol conformance suffices | — | Yes |

**Keep hierarchies shallow** (1-2 levels). Deep chains complicate schema migrations and queries.

## ModelContainer Setup

### SwiftUI App

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftData

@main
struct MusicApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .modelContainer(for: [Track.self, Album.self])
    }
}
```

### Custom Configuration

```swift
let schema = Schema([Track.self, Album.self])

let config = ModelConfiguration(
    schema: schema,
    url: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/database.sqlite"),
    cloudKitDatabase: .private("iCloud.com.example.app")
)

let container = try ModelContainer(
    for: schema,
    configurations: config
)
```

### In-Memory (Tests)

```swift
let config = ModelConfiguration(isStoredInMemoryOnly: true)
let container = try ModelContainer(
    for: schema,
    configurations: config
)
```

## Queries in SwiftUI

### Basic @Query

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftData

struct TracksView: View {
    @Query var tracks: [Track]

    var body: some View {
        List(tracks) { track in
            Text(track.title)
        }
    }
}
```

**Automatic updates** View refreshes when data changes.

### Filtered, Sorted, Combined

```swift
// Filtered
@Query(filter: #Predicate<Track> { $0.genre == "Rock" }) var rockTracks: [Track]

// Sorted (single)
@Query(sort: \.title, order: .forward) var tracks: [Track]

// Sorted (multiple descriptors)
@Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\.artist), SortDescriptor(\.title)]) var tracks: [Track]

// Combined filter + sort
@Query(filter: #Predicate<Track> { $0.duration > 180 }, sort: \.title) var longTracks: [Track]
```

### Sectioned Queries (OS27)

`@Query` gained a `sectionBy:` parameter (`OS27`, all platforms) that groups results without manual post-fetch grouping. The wrapped value stays a flat `[Element]` — sectioning is additive, reached through the **underscored wrapper** `_tracks.sections`:

```swift
struct TracksView: View {
    // sectionBy takes a KeyPath to a String (or String?) on the model.
    @Query(sort: \Track.title, sectionBy: \.genre)
    private var tracks: [Track]

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(_tracks.sections) { section in   // ResultsSectionCollection<Track, String>
                Section(section.id) {                // section.id == the section key (the genre)
                    ForEach(section) { track in      // each section IS a collection of its Tracks
                        Text(track.title)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`_tracks.sections` is a `ResultsSectionCollection<Track, String>`; each element is a `ResultsSection<Track, String>` — `Identifiable` (`.id` == the section key) and a `RandomAccessCollection` of that section's models (`sectionNames`, `contains(sectionName:)`, `index(ofSectionNamed:)` are also available). Flat `tracks` keeps working, so adoption is incremental.

## Observing Results Outside SwiftUI — `ResultsObserver` (OS27)

`@Query` only works inside SwiftUI views. `ResultsObserver` (`OS27`, all platforms) is the programmatic equivalent — SwiftData's answer to `NSFetchedResultsController` — for UIKit/AppKit controllers, `@Observable` state objects, or non-UI code. It fetches with the same primitives as `@Query` (filter, sort, sectioning) and observes the store through Swift Observation.

```swift
@Observable @MainActor
final class TrackListModel {
    private let observer: ResultsObserver<Track, Never>   // Never == unsectioned
    private var token: ObservationTracking.Token?          // retain or observation stops
    var tracks: [Track] = []

    init(modelContext: ModelContext) throws {
        observer = try ResultsObserver<Track, Never>(
            sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.title)],
            modelContext: modelContext
        )
        tracks = Array(observer.results)
        token = withContinuousObservation(options: [.didSet]) { [weak self] _ in
            guard let self else { return }
            self.tracks = Array(self.observer.results)
        }
    }
}
```

- Inits take a `modelContext:` **or** a `modelContainer:`, optional `filterBy:`/`sortBy:` (or a full `FetchDescriptor`), and — for the `SectionName == String` variant — a `sectionBy: KeyPath<Element, String>`; all `throws`.
- Read `observer.results` (a `FetchResultsCollection`), or `observer.sections` when sectioned. For table/collection views, `element(at: IndexPath)` and `indexPath(for:)` map rows ↔ models.
- `withContinuousObservation(options:apply:)` is a new `OS27` Observation API that re-fires on every change and returns an `ObservationTracking.Token` (`~Copyable`) you **must retain** — it supersedes manually re-arming `withObservationTracking`. Options: `.willSet`, `.didSet`, `.deinit`.

## ModelContext Operations

### Accessing ModelContext

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    // ...
}
```

### CRUD Operations

```swift
// Insert
let track = Track(id: "1", title: "Song", artist: "Artist", duration: 240)
modelContext.insert(track)

// Fetch
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>(
    predicate: #Predicate { $0.genre == "Rock" },
    sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.title)]
)
let rockTracks = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)

// Update — just modify properties, SwiftData tracks changes
track.title = "Updated Title"

// Delete
modelContext.delete(track)

// Batch delete
try modelContext.delete(model: Track.self, where: #Predicate { $0.genre == "Classical" })

// Save (optional — auto-saves on view disappear)
try modelContext.save()
```

## Predicates

### Basic Comparisons

```swift
#Predicate<Track> { $0.duration > 180 }
#Predicate<Track> { $0.artist == "Artist Name" }
#Predicate<Track> { $0.genre != nil }
```

### Compound Predicates

```swift
#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.genre == "Rock" && track.duration > 180
}

#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.artist == "Artist" || track.artist == "Other Artist"
}
```

### String Matching

```swift
// Contains
#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.title.contains("Love")
}

// Case-insensitive contains
#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.title.localizedStandardContains("love")
}

// Starts with
#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.artist.hasPrefix("The ")
}
```

### Relationship Predicates

```swift
#Predicate<Track> { track in
    track.album?.title == "Album Name"
}

#Predicate<Album> { album in
    album.tracks.count > 10
}
```

## Swift 6 Concurrency

> **Threading errors are isolation bugs.** If you're seeing `Illegal attempt to establish a relationship between objects in different contexts` from a background notification, push handler, or `BGTaskScheduler` callback, the root cause is usually closure isolation inheritance — the work that fetches in a background `ModelContext` and the work that writes the relationship are running on different actors. Read this section AND axiom-concurrency (skills/isolation-inheritance-diag.md) Pattern 1 for the full runtime-crash catalog.

### @MainActor Isolation

```swift
import SwiftData

@MainActor
@Model
final class Track {
    var id: String
    var title: String

    init(id: String, title: String) {
        self.id = id
        self.title = title
    }
}
```

**Why** SwiftData models are not `Sendable`. Use `@MainActor` to ensure safe access from SwiftUI.

### Background Context

```swift
import SwiftData

actor DataImporter {
    let modelContainer: ModelContainer

    init(container: ModelContainer) {
        self.modelContainer = container
    }

    func importTracks(_ tracks: [TrackData]) async throws {
        // Create background context
        let context = ModelContext(modelContainer)

        for track in tracks {
            let model = Track(
                id: track.id,
                title: track.title,
                artist: track.artist,
                duration: track.duration
            )
            context.insert(model)
        }

        try context.save()
    }
}
```

**Pattern** Use `ModelContext(modelContainer)` for background operations, not `@Environment(\.modelContext)` which is main-actor bound.

#### Calling from SwiftUI

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext

    var body: some View {
        Button("Import") {
            Task {
                let importer = DataImporter(container: modelContext.container)
                try await importer.importTracks(data)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## CloudKit Integration

### Enable CloudKit Sync

```swift
let schema = Schema([Track.self])

let config = ModelConfiguration(
    schema: schema,
    cloudKitDatabase: .private("iCloud.com.example.MusicApp")
)

let container = try ModelContainer(
    for: schema,
    configurations: config
)
```

### Capabilities Required

1. Enable iCloud in Xcode (Signing & Capabilities)
2. Select CloudKit
3. Add iCloud container: `iCloud.com.example.MusicApp`

**Note** SwiftData CloudKit sync is automatic - no manual conflict resolution needed.

### CloudKit Constraints (CRITICAL)

#### When using CloudKit sync, ALL properties must be optional or have default values

```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    var id: String = UUID().uuidString  // ✅ Has default (don't use .unique — CloudKit can't enforce it)
    var title: String = ""  // ✅ Has default
    var duration: TimeInterval = 0  // ✅ Has default
    var genre: String? = nil  // ✅ Optional

    // ❌ These don't work with CloudKit:
    // var requiredField: String  // No default, not optional
}
```

**Why** CloudKit only syncs to private zones, and network delays mean new records may not have all fields populated yet.

#### Handling uniqueness without `.unique`

When you genuinely need uniqueness with CloudKit — a settings singleton, or records keyed by a natural ID (a server `recordID`, ISBN, email) — enforce it in code. There are two cases, and they need different handling.

**Records your own code inserts** (an import, a server fetch you control): use a **fetch-before-insert** upsert at the insert site.

```swift
func upsert(remoteID: String, in context: ModelContext) throws {
    var descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>(
        predicate: #Predicate { $0.remoteID == remoteID }
    )
    descriptor.fetchLimit = 1
    if let existing = try context.fetch(descriptor).first {
        existing.lastSeen = .now          // update in place — no duplicate
    } else {
        context.insert(Track(remoteID: remoteID))
    }
}
```

**Records CloudKit delivers via sync**: you get no insert hook to upsert at, and a fetch-before-insert *races in-flight sync* — the remote copy of a record may not have arrived locally yet, so the fetch misses and a duplicate slips in regardless. Don't dedup on every insert. Instead let sync settle, then run a **deduplication sweep** on a background `ModelContext` at a natural lull (app foreground, a debounced timer, or after your own refresh completes):

```swift
func deduplicate(in context: ModelContext) throws {
    let all = try context.fetch(FetchDescriptor<Track>())
    let groups = Dictionary(grouping: all, by: \.remoteID)
    for (_, dupes) in groups where dupes.count > 1 {
        // keep the earliest record, delete the rest
        let keep = dupes.min { $0.createdAt < $1.createdAt }
        for dupe in dupes where dupe !== keep {
            context.delete(dupe)
        }
    }
    try context.save()
}
```

Run the sweep on a background context (not the main one), keyed by the natural ID, so it doesn't block the UI or fight active sync.

**Relationship Constraint** All relationships must be optional
```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Album.tracks)
    var album: Album?  // ✅ Must be optional for CloudKit
}
```

### Sync Status, Conflicts, Offline Handling

SwiftData CloudKit sync uses **last-write-wins** by default. For sync status monitoring, custom conflict resolution, and offline-aware UI patterns, see `skills/cloud-sync.md`. For CKShare-based record sharing, see `skills/cloudkit-ref.md`.

### Resolving "Property must be optional or have default value" Error

**Problem** You get this error when trying to use CloudKit sync:
```
Property 'title' must be optional or have a default value for CloudKit synchronization
```

#### Solution
```swift
// ❌ Wrong - required property
@Model
final class Track {
    var title: String
}

// ✅ Correct - has default
@Model
final class Track {
    var title: String = ""
}

// ✅ Also correct - optional
@Model
final class Track {
    var title: String?
}
```

### Testing CloudKit Sync (Without iCloud)

```swift
let schema = Schema([Track.self])

// Test configuration (no CloudKit sync)
let testConfig = ModelConfiguration(isStoredInMemoryOnly: true)

let container = try ModelContainer(for: schema, configurations: testConfig)
```

#### For real CloudKit testing
1. Sign in to iCloud on test device
2. Enable CloudKit in Capabilities
3. Use real device (simulator CloudKit is unreliable)
4. Check iCloud status in Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud

## iOS 26+ Features

### Enhanced Relationship Handling

```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    @Relationship(
        deleteRule: .cascade,
        minimumModelCount: 0,
        maximumModelCount: 1,  // Track belongs to at most one album
        inverse: \Album.tracks
    ) var album: Album?
}
```

### Transient Properties

```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    var id: String
    var duration: TimeInterval

    @Transient
    var formattedDuration: String {
        let minutes = Int(duration) / 60
        let seconds = Int(duration) % 60
        return String(format: "%d:%02d", minutes, seconds)
    }
}
```

**Transient** Computed property, not persisted.

### History Tracking

SwiftData records persistent history automatically — there is no `isHistoryEnabled` flag on `ModelConfiguration`. Query the change history with `ModelContext.fetchHistory(_:)` using a `HistoryDescriptor` (iOS 18+):

```swift
var descriptor = HistoryDescriptor<DefaultHistoryTransaction>()
// Optionally filter by token/date via descriptor.predicate

let transactions = try modelContext.fetchHistory(descriptor)
for transaction in transactions {
    for change in transaction.changes {
        switch change {
        case .insert(let inserted): handleInsert(inserted)
        case .update(let updated):  handleUpdate(updated)
        case .delete(let deleted):  handleDelete(deleted)
        }
    }
}

// Prune processed history once you've caught up:
try modelContext.deleteHistory(HistoryDescriptor<DefaultHistoryTransaction>())
```

#### Observing History — `HistoryObserver` (OS27)

`fetchHistory` is a pull. `HistoryObserver` (`OS27`, all platforms) is the push — an `@Observable` object whose `eventCounter` increments whenever new history transactions land, so a sync engine or an extension-aware app reacts without polling:

```swift
@Observable
final class StoreSync {
    private let observer: HistoryObserver
    private var token: ObservationTracking.Token?

    init(modelContainer: ModelContainer) throws {
        // Filter to app-authored changes so you don't replay server-originated ones back.
        observer = try HistoryObserver(authors: ["App"], modelContainer: modelContainer)
        token = withContinuousObservation(options: [.didSet]) { [weak self] _ in
            _ = self?.observer.eventCounter        // touch the observable to re-arm
            self?.processNewTransactions()
        }
    }

    private func processNewTransactions() {
        // Pull the latest with modelContext.fetchHistory(...) and apply them.
    }
}
```

`HistoryObserver(historyTokens:observedModels:authors:modelContainer:)` (everything but `modelContainer` optional) `throws`. Scope it with `observedModels:` and `authors:`, observe `eventCounter`, then pull the actual changes with the existing `ModelContext.fetchHistory(_:)`.

## Performance Patterns

### Batch Fetching

```swift
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>(
    sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.title)]
)
descriptor.fetchLimit = 100  // Paginate results

let tracks = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
```

### Prefetch Relationships (Prevent N+1 Queries)

```swift
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>()
descriptor.relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching = [\.album]  // Eager load album

let tracks = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
// No N+1 queries - albums already loaded
```

**CRITICAL** Without prefetching, accessing `track.album.title` in a loop triggers individual queries for EACH track:

```swift
// ❌ SLOW: N+1 queries (1 fetch tracks + 100 fetch albums)
let tracks = try modelContext.fetch(FetchDescriptor<Track>())
for track in tracks {
    print(track.album?.title)  // 100 separate queries!
}

// ✅ FAST: 2 queries total (1 fetch tracks + 1 fetch all albums)
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>()
descriptor.relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching = [\.album]
let tracks = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
for track in tracks {
    print(track.album?.title)  // Already loaded
}
```

### Faulting (Lazy Loading)

SwiftData uses faulting (lazy loading) by default:

```swift
let track = tracks.first
// Album is a fault - not loaded yet

let albumTitle = track.album?.title
// Album loaded on access (separate query)
```

#### Use faulting strategically
- ✅ Good when you access relationships in only 10-20% of cases
- ✅ Good for large relationship graphs you partially use
- ❌ Bad when you access relationships in loops → use prefetching instead

### Batch Operations (Performance for Large Datasets)

```swift
// ❌ SLOW: 1000 individual saves
for track in largeDataset {
    track.genre = "Updated"
    try modelContext.save()  // Expensive - 1000 times
}

// ✅ FAST: Single save operation
for track in largeDataset {
    track.genre = "Updated"
}
try modelContext.save()  // Once for entire batch
```

### Index Optimization (iOS 18+)

Create indexes on frequently queried properties with the freestanding `#Index` macro (there is no `@Attribute(.indexed)` option). Each array argument is one index — pass multiple arrays for multiple single-column indexes, or one array of several key paths for a compound index:

```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    @Attribute(.unique) var id: String = UUID().uuidString
    var genre: String = ""
    var releaseDate: Date = Date()
    var title: String = ""
    var duration: TimeInterval = 0

    #Index<Track>([\.genre], [\.releaseDate])  // two single-column indexes
}

// Now these queries are faster:
@Query(filter: #Predicate { $0.genre == "Rock" }) var rockTracks: [Track]
@Query(filter: #Predicate { $0.releaseDate > Date() }) var upcomingTracks: [Track]
```

#### When to add indexes
- ✅ Properties used in `@Query` filters frequently
- ✅ Properties used in sort operations
- ✅ Properties used in relationships
- ❌ NOT properties that are rarely filtered
- ❌ NOT properties that change frequently (maintenance cost)

### Memory Optimization: Fetch Chunks

For very large datasets (100k+ records), fetch in chunks:

```swift
actor DataImporter {
    let modelContainer: ModelContainer

    func importLargeDataset(_ items: [Item]) async throws {
        let chunkSize = 1000
        let context = ModelContext(modelContainer)

        for chunk in items.chunked(into: chunkSize) {
            for item in chunk {
                let track = Track(
                    id: item.id,
                    title: item.title,
                    artist: item.artist,
                    duration: item.duration
                )
                context.insert(track)
            }

            try context.save()  // Save after each chunk

            // Prevent memory bloat
            context.delete(model: Track.self, where: #Predicate { _ in true })
        }
    }
}

extension Array {
    func chunked(into size: Int) -> [[Element]] {
        stride(from: 0, to: count, by: size).map {
            Array(self[$0..<Swift.min($0 + size, count)])
        }
    }
}
```

### Avoiding Retain Cycles in CloudKit Sync

When using CloudKit, avoid capturing `self` in closures:

```swift
// ❌ Retain cycle with CloudKit sync
actor TrackManager {
    func startSync() {
        Task {
            for await notification in NotificationCenter.default
                .notifications(named: NSNotification.Name("CloudKitSyncDidComplete")) {
                self.refreshUI()  // Potential retain cycle
            }
        }
    }
}

// ✅ Proper weak capture
actor TrackManager {
    func startSync() {
        Task { [weak self] in
            guard let self else { return }
            for await notification in NotificationCenter.default
                .notifications(named: NSNotification.Name("CloudKitSyncDidComplete")) {
                await self.refreshUI()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Search

```swift
struct SearchableTracksView: View {
    @Query var tracks: [Track]
    @State private var searchText = ""

    var filteredTracks: [Track] {
        if searchText.isEmpty {
            return tracks
        }
        return tracks.filter { track in
            track.title.localizedStandardContains(searchText) ||
            track.artist.localizedStandardContains(searchText)
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        List(filteredTracks) { track in
            Text(track.title)
        }
        .searchable(text: $searchText)
    }
}
```

### Custom Sort

```swift
struct TracksView: View {
    @Query var tracks: [Track]
    @State private var sortOrder: SortOrder = .title

    enum SortOrder {
        case title, artist, duration
    }

    var sortedTracks: [Track] {
        switch sortOrder {
        case .title:
            return tracks.sorted { $0.title < $1.title }
        case .artist:
            return tracks.sorted { $0.artist < $1.artist }
        case .duration:
            return tracks.sorted { $0.duration < $1.duration }
        }
    }
}
```

### Undo/Redo

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
    @Environment(\.undoManager) private var undoManager

    func deleteTrack(_ track: Track) {
        modelContext.delete(track)

        // Undo is automatic with modelContext
        // Use Cmd+Z to undo
    }
}
```

## Migration from Realm & Core Data

### Key Differences at a Glance

| Concept | Realm | Core Data | SwiftData |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model definition | `Object` subclass + `@Persisted` | `NSManagedObject` + `@NSManaged` | `final class` + `@Model` |
| Primary key | `@Persisted(primaryKey:)` | Entity inspector | `@Attribute(.unique)` |
| Threading | Manual per-thread Realm instances | `context.perform {}` blocks | Actor isolation + `ModelContext(container)` |
| Relationships | `RealmSwiftCollection<T>` | Entity editor + `@NSManaged` | `@Relationship` with automatic inverses |
| Background work | `DispatchQueue` + thread-local Realm | `newBackgroundContext()` | `actor` + `ModelContext(modelContainer)` |
| Batch delete | Loop + `realm.delete()` | `NSBatchDeleteRequest` | `context.delete(model:where:)` |
| CloudKit sync | Realm Sync (deprecated Sept 2025) | `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` | `ModelConfiguration(cloudKitDatabase:)` |

## Testing

### Test Setup

```swift
import XCTest
import SwiftData
@testable import MusicApp

final class TrackTests: XCTestCase {
    var modelContext: ModelContext!

    override func setUp() async throws {
        let schema = Schema([Track.self])
        let config = ModelConfiguration(isStoredInMemoryOnly: true)
        let container = try ModelContainer(for: schema, configurations: config)
        modelContext = ModelContext(container)
    }

    func testInsertTrack() throws {
        let track = Track(id: "1", title: "Test", artist: "Artist", duration: 240)
        modelContext.insert(track)

        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Track>()
        let tracks = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)

        XCTAssertEqual(tracks.count, 1)
        XCTAssertEqual(tracks.first?.title, "Test")
    }
}
```

## Comparison: SwiftData vs SQLiteData

| Feature | SwiftData | SQLiteData |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Type** | Reference (class) | Value (struct) |
| **Macro** | `@Model` | `@Table` |
| **Queries** | `@Query` in SwiftUI | `@FetchAll` / `@FetchOne` |
| **Relationships** | `@Relationship` macro | Explicit foreign keys |
| **CloudKit** | Automatic sync | Manual SyncEngine + sharing |
| **Backend** | Core Data | GRDB + SQLite |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy (native) | Moderate |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent (raw SQL) |

## tvOS

**SwiftData on tvOS has no persistent local storage.** tvOS has no Document directory, and Application Support maps to Caches — the system deletes files under storage pressure. A local-only SwiftData store will lose all data.

**You must use CloudKit sync** (`cloudKitDatabase: .private(...)`) for tvOS SwiftData apps. Without iCloud, user data does not survive between app launches. See axiom-swift (skills/tvos.md) for full tvOS storage constraints.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Forgetting explicit init
```swift
@Model
final class Track {
    var id: String
    var title: String
    // No init - won't compile
}
```
**Fix** Always provide `init` for `@Model` classes

### ❌ Using structs
```swift
@Model
struct Track { }  // Won't work - must be class
```
**Fix** Use `final class` not `struct`

### ❌ Background operations on main context
```swift
@Environment(\.modelContext) var context  // Main actor only

Task {
    // ❌ Crash - crossing actor boundaries
    context.insert(track)
}
```
**Fix** Use `ModelContext(modelContainer)` for background work

### ❌ Not saving when needed
```swift
modelContext.insert(track)
// Might not persist immediately
```
**Fix** Call `try modelContext.save()` for immediate persistence
