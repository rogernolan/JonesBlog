# Now Playing Integration Guide

**Purpose**: Prevent the 4 most common Now Playing issues on iOS 18+: info not appearing, commands not working, artwork problems, and state sync issues

**Swift Version**: Swift 6.0+
**iOS Version**: iOS 18+
**Xcode**: Xcode 16+

## Core Philosophy

> "Now Playing eligibility requires THREE things working together: AVAudioSession activation, remote command handlers, and metadata publishing. Missing ANY of these silently breaks the entire system. 90% of Now Playing issues stem from incorrect activation order or missing command handlers, not API bugs."

**Key Insight from WWDC 2022/110338**: Apps must meet two system heuristics:
1. Register handlers for at least one remote command
2. Configure AVAudioSession with a non-mixable category

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use this skill when**:
- Now Playing info doesn't appear on Lock Screen or Control Center
- Play/pause/skip buttons are grayed out or don't respond
- Album artwork is missing, wrong, or flickers between images
- Animated lock-screen artwork (iOS 26+) not appearing — see Pattern 8
- Control Center shows "Playing" when app is paused, or vice versa
- Apple Music or other apps "steal" Now Playing status
- Implementing Now Playing for the first time
- Debugging Now Playing issues in existing implementation
- Integrating CarPlay Now Playing (covered in Pattern 6)
- Working with MusicKit/Apple Music content (covered in Pattern 7)

### iOS 26 Note

iOS 26 introduces **Liquid Glass visual design** for Lock Screen and Control Center Now Playing widgets. This is **automatic system behavior** — no code changes required. The patterns in this skill remain valid for iOS 26.

### OS27 Note — the NowPlaying framework

`OS27` adds a brand-new Swift-native **NowPlaying framework** (`import NowPlaying`) — an `@Observable`, command-declarative successor to the MediaPlayer C-style APIs (`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` + `MPRemoteCommandCenter` + `MPNowPlayingSession`) that Patterns 1–8 teach. If you target iOS 27+ and are starting fresh, prefer it — see [NowPlaying Framework (Modern, Swift-Native)](#nowplaying-framework-modern-swift-native-os27). Apple's session positions it as the modern path but does **not** deprecate the MediaPlayer APIs, so Patterns 1–8 stay correct for apps supporting iOS &lt;27.

❌ **Do NOT use this skill for**:
- Background audio configuration details (see AVFoundation skill)

## Related Skills

- **swift-concurrency** - For @MainActor patterns, weak self in closures, async artwork loading
- **memory-debugging** - For retain cycles in command handlers
- **avfoundation-ref** - For AVAudioSession configuration details

---

## Red Flags / Anti-Patterns

**If you see ANY of these, suspect Now Playing misconfiguration:**

- Info appears briefly then disappears (AVAudioSession deactivated)
- Commands work in simulator but not on device (simulator has different audio stack)
- Artwork shows placeholder then updates (race condition, not necessarily wrong)
- Artwork never appears (format/size issue or MPMediaItemArtwork block returning nil)
- Play/pause state incorrect after backgrounding (not updating on playback rate changes)
- Another app "steals" Now Playing (didn't meet eligibility requirements)
- `playbackState` property doesn't update (iOS doesn't have `playbackState`, macOS only!)

**FORBIDDEN Assumptions:**
- "Just set nowPlayingInfo and it works" - Must have AVAudioSession + command handlers
- "playbackState controls Control Center" - iOS ignores playbackState, uses playbackRate
- "Artwork just needs an image" - Needs proper MPMediaItemArtwork with size handler
- "Commands enable themselves" - Must add target AND set isEnabled = true
- "Update elapsed time every second" - System infers from rate, causes jitter

## Mandatory First Steps (Pre-Diagnosis)

Run this code to understand current state before debugging:

```swift
// 1. Verify AVAudioSession configuration
let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
print("Category: \(session.category.rawValue)")
print("Mode: \(session.mode.rawValue)")
print("Options: \(session.categoryOptions)")
print("Is active: \(try? session.setActive(true))")
// Must be: .playback category, NOT .mixWithOthers option

// 2. Verify background mode
// Info.plist must have: UIBackgroundModes = ["audio"]

// 3. Check command handlers are registered
let commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()
print("Play enabled: \(commandCenter.playCommand.isEnabled)")
print("Pause enabled: \(commandCenter.pauseCommand.isEnabled)")
// Must have at least one command with target AND isEnabled = true

// 4. Check nowPlayingInfo dictionary
if let info = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo {
    print("Title: \(info[MPMediaItemPropertyTitle] ?? "nil")")
    print("Artwork: \(info[MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork] != nil)")
    print("Duration: \(info[MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration] ?? "nil")")
    print("Elapsed: \(info[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] ?? "nil")")
    print("Rate: \(info[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyPlaybackRate] ?? "nil")")
} else {
    print("No nowPlayingInfo set!")
}
```

**What this tells you:**

| Observation | Diagnosis | Pattern |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Category is .ambient or has .mixWithOthers | Won't become Now Playing app | Pattern 1 |
| No commands have targets | System ignores app | Pattern 2 |
| Commands have targets but isEnabled = false | UI grayed out | Pattern 2 |
| Artwork is nil | MPMediaItemArtwork block returning nil | Pattern 3 |
| Animated artwork key set but iOS 26 lock screen still shows static | Key not in `supportedAnimatedArtworkKeys` (silently disregarded) | Pattern 8 |
| playbackRate is 0.0 when playing | Control Center shows paused | Pattern 4 |
| Background mode "audio" not in Info.plist | Info disappears on lock | Pattern 1 |

## Pattern 1: AVAudioSession Configuration (Info Not Appearing)

**Time cost**: 10-15 minutes

### Symptom
- Now Playing info never appears on Lock Screen
- Info appears briefly then disappears on lock
- Works in foreground, disappears in background

### BAD Code

```swift
// ❌ WRONG — Category allows mixing, won't become Now Playing app
class PlayerService {
    func setupAudioSession() throws {
        try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(
            .playback,
            options: .mixWithOthers  // ❌ Mixable = not eligible for Now Playing
        )
        // Never called setActive()  // ❌ Session not activated
    }

    func play() {
        player.play()
        updateNowPlaying()  // ❌ Won't appear - session not active
    }
}
```

### GOOD Code

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — Non-mixable category, activated before playback
class PlayerService {
    func setupAudioSession() throws {
        try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(
            .playback,
            mode: .default,
            options: []  // ✅ No .mixWithOthers = eligible for Now Playing
        )
    }

    func play() async throws {
        // ✅ Activate BEFORE starting playback
        try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)

        player.play()
        updateNowPlaying()  // ✅ Now appears correctly
    }

    func stop() async throws {
        player.pause()

        // ✅ Deactivate AFTER stopping, with notify option
        try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(
            false,
            options: .notifyOthersOnDeactivation
        )
    }
}
```

### Info.plist Requirement

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

### Verification
- Lock screen shows Now Playing controls
- Info persists when app backgrounded
- Survives app switch (unless another app plays)

---

## Pattern 2: Remote Command Registration (Commands Not Working)

**Time cost**: 15-20 minutes

### Symptom
- Play/pause buttons grayed out
- Buttons visible but tapping does nothing
- Skip buttons don't appear
- Commands work once then stop

### BAD Code

```swift
// ❌ WRONG — Missing targets and isEnabled
class PlayerService {
    func setupCommands() {
        let commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()

        // ❌ Added target but forgot isEnabled
        commandCenter.playCommand.addTarget { _ in
            self.player.play()
            return .success
        }
        // playCommand.isEnabled defaults to false!

        // ❌ Never added pause handler

        // ❌ skipForward without preferredIntervals
        commandCenter.skipForwardCommand.addTarget { _ in
            return .success
        }
    }
}
```

### GOOD Code

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — Targets registered, enabled, with proper configuration
@MainActor
class PlayerService {
    private var commandTargets: [Any] = []  // Keep strong references

    func setupCommands() {
        let commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()

        // ✅ Play command - add target AND enable
        let playTarget = commandCenter.playCommand.addTarget { [weak self] _ in
            self?.player.play()
            self?.updateNowPlayingPlaybackState(isPlaying: true)
            return .success
        }
        commandCenter.playCommand.isEnabled = true
        commandTargets.append(playTarget)

        // ✅ Pause command
        let pauseTarget = commandCenter.pauseCommand.addTarget { [weak self] _ in
            self?.player.pause()
            self?.updateNowPlayingPlaybackState(isPlaying: false)
            return .success
        }
        commandCenter.pauseCommand.isEnabled = true
        commandTargets.append(pauseTarget)

        // ✅ Skip forward - set preferredIntervals BEFORE adding target
        commandCenter.skipForwardCommand.preferredIntervals = [15.0]
        let skipForwardTarget = commandCenter.skipForwardCommand.addTarget { [weak self] event in
            guard let skipEvent = event as? MPSkipIntervalCommandEvent else {
                return .commandFailed
            }
            self?.skip(by: skipEvent.interval)
            return .success
        }
        commandCenter.skipForwardCommand.isEnabled = true
        commandTargets.append(skipForwardTarget)

        // ✅ Skip backward
        commandCenter.skipBackwardCommand.preferredIntervals = [15.0]
        let skipBackwardTarget = commandCenter.skipBackwardCommand.addTarget { [weak self] event in
            guard let skipEvent = event as? MPSkipIntervalCommandEvent else {
                return .commandFailed
            }
            self?.skip(by: -skipEvent.interval)
            return .success
        }
        commandCenter.skipBackwardCommand.isEnabled = true
        commandTargets.append(skipBackwardTarget)
    }

    func teardownCommands() {
        let commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()
        commandCenter.playCommand.removeTarget(nil)
        commandCenter.pauseCommand.removeTarget(nil)
        commandCenter.skipForwardCommand.removeTarget(nil)
        commandCenter.skipBackwardCommand.removeTarget(nil)
        commandTargets.removeAll()
    }

    deinit {
        teardownCommands()
    }
}
```

### Verification
- Buttons not grayed out in Control Center
- Tapping play/pause actually plays/pauses
- Skip buttons show with correct interval (15s)

---

## Pattern 3: Artwork Configuration (Artwork Problems)

**Time cost**: 15-25 minutes

### Symptom
- Artwork never appears (generic placeholder)
- Wrong artwork for current track
- Artwork flickers between images
- Artwork appears then disappears

### BAD Code

```swift
// ❌ WRONG — MPMediaItemArtwork block can return nil, no size handling
func updateNowPlaying() {
    var nowPlayingInfo = [String: Any]()
    nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyTitle] = track.title

    // ❌ Storing UIImage directly (doesn't work)
    nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork] = image

    // ❌ Or: Block that ignores requested size
    let artwork = MPMediaItemArtwork(boundsSize: image.size) { _ in
        return self.cachedImage  // ❌ May be nil, ignores requested size
    }

    MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
}

// ❌ WRONG — Multiple rapid updates cause flickering
func loadArtwork(from url: URL) {
    // Request 1
    loadImage(url) { image in
        self.updateNowPlayingArtwork(image)  // Update 1
    }
    // Request 2 (cached) returns faster
    loadCachedImage(url) { image in
        self.updateNowPlayingArtwork(image)  // Update 2 - flicker!
    }
}
```

### GOOD Code

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — Proper MPMediaItemArtwork with value capture (Swift 6 compliant)
@MainActor
class NowPlayingService {
    private var currentArtworkURL: URL?

    func updateNowPlayingArtwork(_ image: UIImage, for trackURL: URL) {
        // ✅ Prevent race conditions - only update if still current track
        guard trackURL == currentArtworkURL else { return }

        // ✅ Create MPMediaItemArtwork with VALUE CAPTURE (not stored property)
        // This is Swift 6 strict concurrency compliant — UIImage is immutable
        // and safe to capture across isolation domains
        let artwork = MPMediaItemArtwork(boundsSize: image.size) { [image] requestedSize in
            // ✅ System calls this block from any thread
            // Captured value avoids "Main actor-isolated property" error
            return image
        }

        // ✅ Update only artwork key, preserve other values
        var nowPlayingInfo = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork] = artwork
        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
    }

    // ✅ Single entry point with priority: embedded > cached > remote
    func loadArtwork(for track: Track) async {
        currentArtworkURL = track.artworkURL

        // Priority 1: Embedded in file (immediate, no flicker)
        if let embedded = await extractEmbeddedArtwork(track.fileURL) {
            updateNowPlayingArtwork(embedded, for: track.artworkURL)
            return
        }

        // Priority 2: Already cached (fast)
        if let cached = await loadFromCache(track.artworkURL) {
            updateNowPlayingArtwork(cached, for: track.artworkURL)
            return
        }

        // Priority 3: Remote (slow, but don't flicker)
        // ✅ Set placeholder first, then update once with real image
        if let remote = await downloadImage(track.artworkURL) {
            updateNowPlayingArtwork(remote, for: track.artworkURL)
        }
    }
}
```

**Why value capture, not `nonisolated(unsafe)`**: The closure passed to `MPMediaItemArtwork` may be called by the system from any thread. Under Swift 6 strict concurrency, accessing `@MainActor`-isolated stored properties from this closure would cause a compile error. Capturing the image value directly is cleaner than using `nonisolated(unsafe)` because UIImage is immutable and thread-safe for reads.

### Artwork Size Guidelines
- Lock Screen: 300x300 points (600x600 @2x, 900x900 @3x)
- Control Center: Various sizes
- **Best practice**: Provide image at least 600x600 pixels

### Verification
- Artwork appears on Lock Screen
- Correct artwork for current track
- No flickering when track changes
- Artwork persists after backgrounding

**For iOS 26+ animated artwork** (full-screen Lock Screen video), see Pattern 8. Always set `MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork` (this pattern) alongside the animated keys so iOS 18-25 users still see static artwork.

---

## Pattern 4: Playback State Synchronization (State Sync Issues)

**Time cost**: 10-20 minutes

### Symptom
- Control Center shows "Playing" when actually paused
- Progress bar doesn't move or jumps unexpectedly
- Duration shows wrong value
- Scrubbing doesn't work correctly

### BAD Code

```swift
// ❌ WRONG — Using playbackState (macOS only, ignored on iOS)
func updatePlaybackState(isPlaying: Bool) {
    MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().playbackState = isPlaying ? .playing : .paused
    // ❌ iOS ignores this property! Only macOS uses it.
}

// ❌ WRONG — Updating elapsed time on a timer (causes drift)
Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1.0, repeats: true) { _ in
    var info = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]
    info[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] = self.player.currentTime().seconds
    MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = info
    // ❌ Every second creates jitter, system already infers from timestamp
}

// ❌ WRONG — Partial dictionary updates cause race conditions
func updateTitle() {
    var info = [String: Any]()
    info[MPMediaItemPropertyTitle] = track.title
    MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = info
    // ❌ Cleared all other values (artwork, duration, etc.)!
}
```

### GOOD Code

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — Use playbackRate for iOS, update at key moments only
@MainActor
class NowPlayingService {

    // ✅ Update when playback STARTS
    func playbackStarted(track: Track, player: AVPlayer) {
        var nowPlayingInfo = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]

        // ✅ Core metadata
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyTitle] = track.title
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyArtist] = track.artist
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle] = track.album
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration] = player.currentItem?.duration.seconds ?? 0

        // ✅ Playback state via RATE (not playbackState property)
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] = player.currentTime().seconds
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyPlaybackRate] = 1.0  // Playing

        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
    }

    // ✅ Update when playback PAUSES
    func playbackPaused(player: AVPlayer) {
        var nowPlayingInfo = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]

        // ✅ Update elapsed time AND rate together
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] = player.currentTime().seconds
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyPlaybackRate] = 0.0  // Paused

        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
    }

    // ✅ Update when user SEEKS
    func userSeeked(to time: CMTime, player: AVPlayer) {
        var nowPlayingInfo = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]

        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] = time.seconds
        // ✅ Keep current rate (don't change playing/paused state)

        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
    }

    // ✅ Update when track CHANGES
    func trackChanged(to newTrack: Track, player: AVPlayer) {
        // ✅ Full refresh of all metadata
        var nowPlayingInfo = [String: Any]()

        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyTitle] = newTrack.title
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyArtist] = newTrack.artist
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle] = newTrack.album
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyPlaybackDuration] = player.currentItem?.duration.seconds ?? 0
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyElapsedPlaybackTime] = 0.0
        nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoPropertyPlaybackRate] = player.rate

        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo

        // Then load artwork asynchronously
        Task {
            await loadArtwork(for: newTrack)
        }
    }
}
```

### When to Update Now Playing Info

| Event | What to Update |
|-------|---------------|
| Playback starts | All metadata + elapsed=current + rate=1.0 |
| Playback pauses | elapsed=current + rate=0.0 |
| User seeks | elapsed=newPosition (keep rate) |
| Track changes | All metadata (new track) |
| Playback rate changes (2x, 0.5x) | rate=newRate |

### DO NOT Update
- On a timer (system infers from elapsed + rate + timestamp)
- Elapsed time continuously (causes jitter)
- Partial dictionaries (loses other values)

---

## Pattern 5: MPNowPlayingSession (iOS 16+ Recommended Approach)

**Time cost**: 20-30 minutes

### When to Use MPNowPlayingSession
- iOS 16+ (available since iOS 16, previously tvOS only)
- Using AVPlayer for playback
- Want automatic publishing of playback state
- Multiple players (Picture-in-Picture scenarios)

### BAD Code (Manual Approach - More Error-Prone)

```swift
// ❌ Manual updates are error-prone, easy to miss state changes
class OldStylePlayer {
    func play() {
        player.play()
        // Must remember to:
        updateNowPlayingElapsed()
        updateNowPlayingRate()
        // Easy to forget one...
    }
}
```

### GOOD Code (MPNowPlayingSession)

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — MPNowPlayingSession handles automatic publishing
@MainActor
class ModernPlayerService {
    private var player: AVPlayer
    private var session: MPNowPlayingSession?

    init() {
        player = AVPlayer()
        setupSession()
    }

    func setupSession() {
        // ✅ Create session with player
        session = MPNowPlayingSession(players: [player])

        // ✅ Enable automatic publishing of:
        // - Duration
        // - Elapsed time
        // - Playback state (rate)
        // - Playback progress
        session?.automaticallyPublishNowPlayingInfo = true

        // ✅ Register commands on SESSION's command center (not shared)
        session?.remoteCommandCenter.playCommand.addTarget { [weak self] _ in
            self?.player.play()
            return .success
        }
        session?.remoteCommandCenter.playCommand.isEnabled = true

        session?.remoteCommandCenter.pauseCommand.addTarget { [weak self] _ in
            self?.player.pause()
            return .success
        }
        session?.remoteCommandCenter.pauseCommand.isEnabled = true

        // ✅ Try to become active Now Playing session
        session?.becomeActiveIfPossible { success in
            print("Became active Now Playing: \(success)")
        }
    }

    func play(track: Track) async {
        let item = AVPlayerItem(url: track.url)

        // ✅ Set static metadata on player item (title, artwork)
        item.nowPlayingInfo = [
            MPMediaItemPropertyTitle: track.title,
            MPMediaItemPropertyArtist: track.artist,
            MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork: await createArtwork(for: track)
        ]

        player.replaceCurrentItem(with: item)
        player.play()
        // ✅ No need to manually update elapsed time, rate, duration
        // MPNowPlayingSession publishes automatically!
    }
}
```

### Multiple Sessions (Picture-in-Picture)

```swift
class MultiPlayerService {
    var mainSession: MPNowPlayingSession
    var pipSession: MPNowPlayingSession

    func pipDidExpand() {
        // ✅ Promote PiP session when it expands to full screen
        pipSession.becomeActiveIfPossible { success in
            // PiP now controls Lock Screen, Control Center
        }
    }

    func pipDidMinimize() {
        // ✅ Demote back to main session
        mainSession.becomeActiveIfPossible { success in
            // Main player now controls Lock Screen, Control Center
        }
    }
}
```

### Critical Gotcha

**When using MPNowPlayingSession**: Use `session.remoteCommandCenter`, NOT `MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()`

```swift
// ❌ WRONG
let commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()
commandCenter.playCommand.addTarget { _ in }

// ✅ CORRECT
session.remoteCommandCenter.playCommand.addTarget { _ in }
```

## Pattern 6: CarPlay Integration

For CarPlay-specific integration patterns, see `skills/now-playing-carplay.md`.

**Key insight**: CarPlay uses the SAME MPNowPlayingInfoCenter and MPRemoteCommandCenter as iOS. If your Now Playing works on iOS, it works in CarPlay with zero additional code.

---

## Pattern 7: MusicKit Integration (Apple Music)

For MusicKit-specific integration patterns and hybrid app examples, see `skills/now-playing-musickit.md`.

**Key insight**: MusicKit's ApplicationMusicPlayer automatically publishes to MPNowPlayingInfoCenter. You don't need to manually update Now Playing info when playing Apple Music content.

## Pressure Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Apple Music Keeps Taking Over (24-Hour Launch Deadline)

#### Situation
- App launching tomorrow
- QA reports: "Now Playing works, but when user opens Apple Music then returns to our app, our controls disappear"
- Product manager: "This is a blocker, users will think our app is broken"
- You're 2 hours from code freeze

#### Rationalization Traps (DO NOT)
1. *"Just tell users not to use Apple Music"* - Unacceptable UX, will get 1-star reviews
2. *"Force our app to always be Now Playing"* - Impossible, system controls eligibility
3. *"File a bug with Apple"* - Won't help before launch

#### Root Cause
Your app loses eligibility because:
- Using `.mixWithOthers` option (allows other apps to play simultaneously)
- Not calling `becomeActiveIfPossible()` when returning to foreground
- AVAudioSession deactivated when backgrounded

#### Systematic Fix (30 minutes)

```swift
// 1. Remove mixWithOthers
try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, options: [])

// 2. Reactivate when returning to foreground
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: UIApplication.willEnterForegroundNotification,
    object: nil,
    queue: .main
) { [weak self] _ in
    guard self?.isPlaying == true else { return }

    do {
        try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)
        self?.session?.becomeActiveIfPossible { _ in }
    } catch {
        print("Failed to reactivate audio session: \(error)")
    }
}

// 3. Handle interruptions (phone call, Siri)
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: AVAudioSession.interruptionNotification,
    object: nil,
    queue: .main
) { [weak self] notification in
    guard let info = notification.userInfo,
          let typeValue = info[AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeKey] as? UInt,
          let type = AVAudioSession.InterruptionType(rawValue: typeValue) else {
        return
    }

    if type == .ended {
        // ✅ Reactivate after interruption
        try? AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)
        self?.session?.becomeActiveIfPossible { _ in }
    }
}
```

#### Communication Template

```
To PM: Found root cause - our audio session config allowed Apple Music to take over.
Fix implemented: 3 changes to audio session handling.
Testing: Verified fix with Apple Music, Spotify, phone calls.
ETA: 20 more minutes for full regression test.

To QA: Please test this flow:
1. Play audio in our app
2. Open Apple Music, play a song
3. Return to our app, tap play
4. Lock screen should show OUR controls
```

#### Time Saved
- 2-3 hours of debugging speculation
- Launch delay avoided
- QA confidence restored

---

### Scenario 2: Artwork Flickers Every Track Change

#### Situation
- User feedback: "Album art keeps flashing when songs change"
- Analytics show 3-4 artwork updates per track change
- Designer: "This looks unprofessional"

#### Root Cause
Multiple artwork sources racing:
1. Cache check (async)
2. Remote URL fetch (async)
3. Embedded artwork extraction (async)

All three complete at different times, each updating Now Playing

#### Fix (20 minutes)

```swift
// ✅ Single-source-of-truth with cancellation
private var artworkTask: Task<Void, Never>?

func loadArtwork(for track: Track) {
    // Cancel previous artwork load
    artworkTask?.cancel()

    artworkTask = Task { @MainActor in
        // Clear previous artwork immediately (optional)
        // updateNowPlayingArtwork(nil)

        // Wait for best available artwork
        let artwork = await loadBestArtwork(for: track)

        // Check if still current track
        guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }

        // Single update
        updateNowPlayingArtwork(artwork, for: track.artworkURL)
    }
}

private func loadBestArtwork(for track: Track) async -> UIImage? {
    // Priority order: embedded > cached > remote
    if let embedded = await extractEmbeddedArtwork(track) {
        return embedded
    }
    if let cached = await loadFromCache(track.artworkURL) {
        return cached
    }
    return await downloadImage(track.artworkURL)
}
```

#### Communication Template

```
To Designer: Fixed artwork flicker - reduced from 3-4 updates to 1 per track.
Root cause: Multiple async sources racing to update artwork.
Solution: Task cancellation + priority order (embedded > cached > remote).
Testing: Verified with 10 track changes, zero flicker.
```

#### Time Saved
- 1-2 hours investigating image caching
- Designer approval unblocked
- Professional UX restored

## Pattern 8: Animated Artwork (iOS 26+)

**Time cost**: 20-40 minutes

iOS 26 introduces full-screen animated Lock Screen artwork via `MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork`. Apple opened this API to all third-party audio apps — music, audiobooks, podcasts, anything with motion-friendly cover art.

### Symptom
- Animated artwork doesn't appear on iOS 26 Lock Screen — falls back to static
- Animated keys set but seemingly ignored
- New artwork doesn't update when track changes
- Animated artwork loads then disappears
- Crashes on iOS 18-25 (referencing iOS 26-only symbols)

### BAD Code

```swift
// ❌ WRONG — Setting animated keys without capability check (silently ignored)
nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoProperty1x1AnimatedArtwork] = animatedArtwork
nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoProperty3x4AnimatedArtwork] = animatedArtwork  // ❌ Same instance, wrong aspect ratio

// ❌ WRONG — Using a fresh artworkID for the same artwork (forces re-download)
let artwork = MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork(
    artworkID: UUID().uuidString,  // ❌ Different every time → system can't dedupe
    previewImageRequestHandler: { _ in await loadPreview() },
    videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: { _ in await downloadVideo() }
)

// ❌ WRONG — Pre-downloading video unconditionally (wasted bandwidth)
Task {
    let videoURL = await downloadFromCDN(track.animatedArtworkURL)  // ❌ Downloads even if artwork never viewed
    cachedVideoURL = videoURL
}

// ❌ WRONG — Returning a remote URL (must be local file URL)
let artwork = MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork(
    artworkID: track.animatedID,
    previewImageRequestHandler: { size in await loadImage(size) },
    videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: { _ in
        URL(string: "https://cdn.example.com/animated.mp4")  // ❌ System rejects remote URLs
    }
)

// ❌ WRONG — Dropping static artwork when adding animated (breaks iOS 18-25)
nowPlayingInfo.removeValue(forKey: MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork)
nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoProperty1x1AnimatedArtwork] = animatedArtwork  // ❌ iOS 18-25 now show no artwork
```

### GOOD Code

```swift
// ✅ CORRECT — Capability-gated, ID-stable, lazy-loaded, with static fallback
@MainActor
class AnimatedArtworkService {

    func updateNowPlaying(for track: Track, staticImage: UIImage) {
        var nowPlayingInfo = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo ?? [:]

        // Always set static artwork — backward compat for iOS 18-25
        // and the system fallback when animation is suppressed (low power, Reduce Motion, etc.)
        let staticArtwork = MPMediaItemArtwork(boundsSize: staticImage.size) { [staticImage] _ in
            staticImage
        }
        nowPlayingInfo[MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork] = staticArtwork

        // iOS 26+ animated artwork — gated on platform support
        if #available(iOS 26.0, macOS 26.0, tvOS 26.0, visionOS 26.0, watchOS 26.0, *) {
            let supported = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.supportedAnimatedArtworkKeys

            // ✅ Use album-stable ID, NOT track-unique — same animation across album songs
            let artworkID = "album:\(track.albumID)"

            if supported.contains(MPNowPlayingInfoProperty1x1AnimatedArtwork) {
                nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoProperty1x1AnimatedArtwork] =
                    makeAnimatedArtwork(artworkID: artworkID, aspect: .square, track: track)
            }
            if supported.contains(MPNowPlayingInfoProperty3x4AnimatedArtwork) {
                nowPlayingInfo[MPNowPlayingInfoProperty3x4AnimatedArtwork] =
                    makeAnimatedArtwork(artworkID: artworkID, aspect: .tall, track: track)
            }
        }

        MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default().nowPlayingInfo = nowPlayingInfo
    }

    @available(iOS 26.0, *)
    private func makeAnimatedArtwork(
        artworkID: String,
        aspect: ArtworkAspect,
        track: Track
    ) -> MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork {
        // ✅ Async closures with VALUE CAPTURE — Swift 6 strict concurrency safe
        // ✅ System only invokes these when artwork is actually being viewed
        let albumID = track.albumID
        let aspectRatio = aspect

        return MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork(
            artworkID: artworkID,
            previewImageRequestHandler: { [weak self] requestedSize in
                // First-frame still — return synchronously when possible.
                // ✅ guard let, NOT `await self?.method()` — optional chaining on an
                // async call returning Optional<T> produces Optional<Optional<T>>,
                // which won't satisfy the handler's `UIImage?` return type.
                guard let self else { return nil }
                return await self.loadPreviewImage(albumID: albumID, aspect: aspectRatio, size: requestedSize)
            },
            videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: { [weak self] requestedSize in
                // ✅ Local file URL only — download to disk first, then return file URL
                guard let self else { return nil }
                return await self.localVideoURL(albumID: albumID, aspect: aspectRatio, size: requestedSize)
            }
        )
    }
}

enum ArtworkAspect { case square, tall }
```

### Why This Pattern

**`artworkID` is the cache key.** The system uses it to detect changes — keep it stable for the same artwork (e.g., `"album:\(albumID)"` for all songs on an album). A new ID forces the system to re-request both preview and video. A `UUID()` per call defeats caching entirely.

**`supportedAnimatedArtworkKeys` is mandatory.** Apple's docs are explicit: "Any animated artwork keys not included in this collection will be disregarded." Don't assume both 1:1 and 3:4 are accepted on every platform — watchOS or tvOS may only accept one (or none).

**Lazy loading is the contract.** The system invokes the request handlers only when the artwork is being viewed. Don't pre-download video assets unconditionally — Apple specifically warns: "Avoid performing expensive network requests for video assets in advance, as the system may ultimately not request the asset."

**Local file URLs only.** The video handler must return a `file://` URL on disk. Download to a cache directory first, then return that path. URLs must remain valid for the lifetime of the `MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork` in your `nowPlayingInfo` — invalidate them only when you replace or remove the artwork.

**Always set static `MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork` too.** The system falls back to the preview image (and to your static `MPMediaItemArtwork`) under several conditions: low-power mode, low-data mode, high thermal level, Reduce Motion enabled, or Auto-Play Animated Images turned off. Plus iOS 18-25 users see only the static artwork.

### Asset Recommendations

| Constraint | Why |
|------------|-----|
| Aspect ratio matches the key (1:1 or 3:4) | System won't crop/letterbox to fit |
| Frame rate ≤60 fps | Higher frame rates may not display |
| Loop length <30 seconds | Apple recommends short, seamless loops |
| Loops without visible jump or fade | Avoid noticeable seams when video repeats |
| Any local asset playable by `AVPlayerLayer` | No file size limit, but format must be playable |
| Animated content is an extension of static artwork | Apple's design guidance — match brand identity |
| Video is complementary to the playing media | Don't ship unrelated content (ads, branding splashes) |

### When Animation Is Suppressed (System Falls Back to Preview)

The system shows the **preview image** (not the video) under these conditions — your preview image must be presentable on its own:

- Low-power mode
- Low-data mode
- High thermal state
- Reduce Motion accessibility setting enabled
- Auto-Play Animated Images setting disabled

### Three Initializer Forms

```swift
// Async/UIKit (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS, Mac Catalyst)
convenience init(
    artworkID: String,
    previewImageRequestHandler: (CGSize) async -> UIImage?,
    videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: (CGSize) async -> URL?
)

// Async/AppKit (macOS native)
convenience init(
    artworkID: String,
    previewImageRequestHandler: (CGSize) async -> NSImage?,
    videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: (CGSize) async -> URL?
)

// Designated initializer with completion handlers (legacy interop)
init(
    artworkID: String,
    previewImageRequestHandler: (CGSize, (UIImage?) -> Void) -> Void,
    videoAssetFileURLRequestHandler: (CGSize, (URL?) -> Void) -> Void
)
```

Prefer the async forms unless you're bridging callback-based code.

### Verification

- Run on iOS 26+ device or simulator (animated APIs are no-ops on older OS)
- Confirm `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.supportedAnimatedArtworkKeys` includes the keys you set
- Lock the device — animated artwork plays full-screen behind Liquid Glass platter
- Toggle Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Auto-Play Animated Images off — preview image should appear
- Enable Low Power Mode — preview image should appear
- Verify static `MPMediaItemPropertyArtwork` still appears on an iOS 18 device (backward compat)
- Switch tracks within the same album → no re-download (same `artworkID`)
- Switch albums → re-request fires (different `artworkID`)

## NowPlaying Framework (Modern, Swift-Native) `OS27`

`import NowPlaying` is a new Swift framework that replaces the manual MediaPlayer dance — building an `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.nowPlayingInfo` dictionary by hand and registering per-command handlers on `MPRemoteCommandCenter` (Patterns 1–4). Instead, your `@Observable` player model conforms to `MediaSessionRepresentable`, you hand it to a `MediaSession`, and the system **observes the model** — Lock Screen, Control Center, CarPlay, and the rest stay in sync automatically, with no manual refresh calls.

Available on all platforms at 27 (`iOS 27, macOS 27, watchOS 27, tvOS 27, visionOS 27`). The local path below is universal; the remote/server-driven path is **iOS-only**.

### Local playback (the common case)

```swift
import NowPlaying
import Observation

@Observable @MainActor
final class PlayerModel: MediaSessionRepresentable {
    let id = "main-player"
    var nowPlaying: Track?
    var isPlaying = false
    var elapsed: TimeInterval = 0

    // Strongly typed content — pick the type that fits (MusicContent, PodcastContent,
    // MovieContent, TVShowContent, RadioContent, BookContent, HomeMediaContent, GenericContent).
    var content: (any MediaContentRepresentable)? {
        guard let track = nowPlaying else { return nil }
        return MusicContent(
            id: track.id,
            songTitle: track.title,
            artistName: track.artist,
            albumName: track.album,
            type: .audio,
            duration: .finite(track.duration),      // or .live for streams — NOT ".continuous"
            artwork: Artwork(id: track.id) { size in
                try ArtworkRepresentation(data: await track.artworkData(for: size))
            }
        )
    }

    var playbackSnapshot: MediaPlaybackSnapshot? {
        MediaPlaybackSnapshot(state: isPlaying ? .playing() : .paused, elapsedTime: elapsed)
    }

    // Declarative commands — each is an async-throwing closure the system invokes.
    var commands: [MediaCommand] {
        [
            .play { [weak self] in self?.resume() },
            .pause { [weak self] in self?.pause() },
            .next { [weak self] in self?.skipNext() },
            .previous { [weak self] in self?.skipPrevious() },
            .seekToPosition { [weak self] position in self?.seek(to: position) },
            .changeRepeatMode(current: .off) { [weak self] mode in self?.setRepeat(mode) },
        ]
    }
}

// Publish it. Retain the session for as long as the model is the active "now playing" source.
@available(iOS 27, macOS 27, watchOS 27, tvOS 27, visionOS 27, *)
let session = MediaSession(playerModel)   // observes the @Observable model; no manual updates
```

Key shapes (SDK-verified against the NowPlaying `-target arm64e-apple-ios27.0` interface):
- **`MediaSessionRepresentable`** (`@MainActor`) requires exactly four members: `id`, `content`, `playbackSnapshot`, `commands`.
- **`MediaPlaybackSnapshot(state:defaultPlaybackRate:elapsedTime:timestamp:)`** — `PlaybackState` is `.stopped`, `.playing(rate:)`, `.paused`, `.buffering`, `.interrupted`.
- **`MediaDuration`** is `.live` or `.finite(TimeInterval)`. (The WWDC talk says "`.continuous`" — the SDK has no such case; use `.live`.)
- **`MediaCommand`** factories: `.play`, `.pause`, `.stop`, `.togglePlayPause`, `.next`, `.previous`, `.skipForward(preferredIntervals:)`, `.skipBackward(preferredIntervals:)`, `.seekToPosition`, `.seekForward(beginAction:endAction:)`, `.seekBackward(…)`, `.changePlaybackRate(supported:)`, `.changeRepeatMode(current:supported:)`, `.changeShuffleMode(current:supported:)`, `.feedback(title:shortTitle:status:)`. Chain `.enabled(false)` to dim one.
- **`Artwork(id:artworkProvider:)`** and **`AnimatedArtwork(id:supportedAspectRatios:preview:video:)`** — both lazy `async` providers keyed on a `CGSize`; the provider returns `ArtworkRepresentation(data:)` or `ArtworkRepresentation(cgImage:)` (both `throws`).
- **`MediaSession`** is `@MainActor` and **unavailable in app extensions**; it exposes `isApplicationPrimary` / `requestToBecomeApplicationPrimary()` (and iOS-only `isSystemPrimary` / `requestToBecomeSystemPrimary()`).

### Remote / server-driven playback (iOS-only)

For apps that control playback happening on **another device** (a speaker, TV, or cast target), NowPlaying provides a push-driven app-extension model so the system surfaces stay live even when your app isn't running:

- Your attributes type conforms to **`RemoteMediaSessionAttributes`** (Codable). Start/refresh with `RemoteMediaSession.start(attributes:)`, `.update(_:)`, `.end()`; enumerate with `.sessions()`. Push-to-start via `RemoteMediaSession.pushToStartToken` / `.pushToStartTokenUpdates`.
- A **`RemoteMediaSessionExtension`** (an `ExtensionFoundation.AppExtension`) implements `func session(_ attributes:) async throws -> Session`, returning a `RemoteMediaSessionRepresentable` rebuilt from the pushed attributes; wire it with `RemoteMediaSessionExtensionConfiguration(extension: self)`.
- The representable adds `var devices: [MediaDevice]` — each **`MediaDevice(id:name:type:capabilities:)`** advertises volume control via `.absoluteVolume(_:onChange:)` or `.relativeVolume(onIncrement:onDecrement:)`. (Note: `NowPlaying.MediaDevice` is distinct from the separate `MediaDevice.framework`.)

### Relationship to the MediaPlayer patterns

NowPlaying is the recommended path on 27. Apple's WWDC session does **not** deprecate `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`, `MPRemoteCommandCenter`, or `MPNowPlayingSession` — so Patterns 1–8 remain correct for apps that support iOS &lt;27 or haven't migrated. The same eligibility rule still applies conceptually: publish content + handle at least one command + own an active, non-mixable audio session.
