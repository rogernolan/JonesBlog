## Decision Tree

```dot

    start [label="Media task" shape=ellipse];
    what [label="Which media feature?" shape=diamond];

    start -> what;

1. Camera capture? → `skills/camera-capture.md` (patterns), `skills/camera-capture-ref.md` (API), `skills/camera-capture-diag.md` (debugging)
2. Photo pickers / library? → `skills/photo-library.md`, `skills/photo-library-ref.md`
3. Audio / AVFoundation? → `skills/avfoundation-ref.md`
4. ShazamKit / audio recognition? → `skills/shazamkit.md`, `skills/shazamkit-ref.md`
5. On-device music analysis (key, tempo, structure, pace, instruments, loudness)? → `skills/music-understanding.md` (`OS27`)
6. Haptics? → `skills/haptics.md`
7. Now Playing / remote commands? → `skills/now-playing.md`, `skills/now-playing-carplay.md`, `skills/now-playing-musickit.md`
8. CarPlay app design, category selection, entitlement request? → `skills/carplay-hig.md` (start here for any CarPlay work)
9. DockKit motorized stands / gimbals, subject tracking, custom motor control? → `skills/dockkit.md`
10. Want camera code audit? → Launch `camera-auditor` agent (detects deprecated APIs and architectural gaps: missing interruption handlers, runtime-error recovery, audio session deactivation, permission-denied UX, RotationCoordinator on iOS 17+; scores RELIABLE / FRAGILE / BROKEN)

## Cross-Domain Routing

**Camera + permissions** (camera access denied, Info.plist missing):
- Camera code → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Privacy manifest / Info.plist → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- Build/entitlement errors → **invoke axiom-build**

**ShazamKit + microphone permissions**:
- Microphone NSMicrophoneUsageDescription → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)
- ShazamKit API and matching → **stay here** (shazamkit)

**Now Playing + background audio**:
- Now Playing metadata/controls → **stay here** (now-playing)
- Background audio mode / BGTaskScheduler → **invoke axiom-integration** (background-processing reference)

**Photo library + privacy**:
- Photo picker (PHPicker, PhotosPicker) → **stay here** (photo-library) — no permissions needed
- Full PHPhotoLibrary access → **stay here** (photo-library-ref) — limited access model
- Privacy manifest for photo usage → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

**DockKit + camera / custom inference**:
- DockKit stand control, framing, motor, tracking states → **stay here** (dockkit)
- Underlying AVCaptureSession setup → **stay here** (camera-capture)
- Custom Vision / Core ML inference feeding observations → **invoke axiom-vision**
- Camera permission (NSCameraUsageDescription) → **invoke axiom-integration** (privacy-ux reference)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Camera capture is just AVCaptureSession setup" | Camera has interruption handlers, rotation, and threading requirements. |
| "Camera launch is fast enough if I startRunning() early" | Output initialization dominates launch; iOS 26 deferred start halves time-to-preview. |
| "I'll add haptics with a simple API call" | Haptic design has patterns for each interaction type matching HIG. |
| "ShazamKit is just SHSession + a delegate" | iOS 17+ has SHManagedSession which eliminates all AVAudioEngine boilerplate. |
| "Now Playing info is just setting metadata" | Remote commands, artwork handling, and state sync have 15+ gotchas. |
| "I'll use UIImagePickerController for photos" | PHPicker/PhotosPicker are the modern API — no permissions required. |
| "DockKit is just pairing a stand" | Custom control needs system tracking disabled, handles inverted dock states, and two different coordinate origins. |
